# ArgoRealTimeSource
Real time processing code for CSIRO, BOM and RAN Australian Argo floats

The code consists of matlab files to process real time Argo float data for delivery to the Global Data Acquisition Centres (GDACS).
Argo floats collect ocean temperature, pressure and salinity data on a 10-day cycle and drift around the ocean for up to 
10 years collecting this data.

More information on the program can be found at: http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/ and http://www.jcommops.org/board?t=Argo

The code here has been developed over many years by CSIRO for processing Australian floats. It is currently shared with several
other countries and is available for use for any country.

Any changes that are made to improve the code should be put through a pull request if possible.

Extra files/toolboxes will need to be downloaded:
