This script permits to have a clear idea on the technical data sent by a float.


In order to run the program, just enter the number of the float in the file: plot_only_one as an int.
For example:  plot_only_one(5903244).

The output is one big figure in Matlab, in order to save it properly, the best idea is to save directly 
from the result in a jpg file.


This program needs to check information on different files, then some change must be done in several files:

float_info : 	line 80   =>   enter the file name where the entire script has been added.

plot_only_one : line 22   =>   enter the file name where the entire script has been added.



Enjoy this program!
